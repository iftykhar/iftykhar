# 👋 Hi, I'm Iftykhar Alam!

### 💻 Aspiring Full-Stack Developer | 🌱 Self-Taught Learner | 🍄 Mushroom Hustler

I'm a Computer Science graduate based in **Dhaka, Bangladesh**, currently leveling up my skills in **modern web development**. I build projects with **Laravel** on the backend and **React/Next.js** on the frontend.

I love clean architecture, functional UI/UX, and solving real-world problems with code — and sometimes with mushrooms. 🍄

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, **Next.js**
- **Backend:** PHP, Laravel
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Composer, Vite
- **Storage:** JSON files (custom implementation), LocalStorage
- **Planning:** MySQL/PostgreSQL, REST APIs, Full-stack deployment

- ✅ Scalable architecture with React & Next.js
- ✅ Authentication & session management
- ✅ Clean code, testing, deployment
